//! RAII wrappers to create a critical section with local IRQs or preemption
//! disabled, used to implement spin locks inÂ kernel.
//!
//! The critical section is created after the guard struct is created, and is
//! ended when the guard falls out of scope.
//!
//! The crate user must implement the [`KernelGuardIf`] trait using
//! [`crate_interface::impl_interface`] to provide the low-level implementantion
//! of how to enable/disable kernel preemption, if the feature `preempt` is
//! enabled.
//!
//! Available guards:
//!
//! - [`NoOp`]: Does nothing around the critical section.
//! - [`IrqSave`]: Disables/enables local IRQs around the critical section.
//!   section.
//!
//! # Crate features
//!
//! - `preempt`: Use in the preemptive system. If this feature is enabled, you
//!    need to implement the [`KernelGuardIf`] trait in other crates. Otherwise
//!    the preemption enable/disable operations will be no-ops. This feature is
//!    disabled by default.
//!
//! # Examples
//!
//! ```
//! use kernel_guard::{KernelGuardIf, NoPreempt};
//!
//! struct KernelGuardIfImpl;
//!
//! #[crate_interface::impl_interface]
//! impl KernelGuardIf for KernelGuardIfImpl {
//!     fn enable_preempt() {
//!         // Your implementation here
//!     }
//!     fn disable_preempt() {
//!         // Your implementation here
//!     }
//! }
//!
//! let guard = NoPreempt::new();
//! /* The critical section starts here
//!
//! Do something that requires preemption to be disabled
//!
//! The critical section ends here */
//! drop(guard);
//! ```
